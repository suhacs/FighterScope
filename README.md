<h1>Fighter Scope (Technologies : MERN Stack) </h1>
Boxing matches occur worldwide, often causing confusion due to the various time zones in each country. Fighter Scope alleviates this confusion by displaying the remaining time until the sporting event in days, hours, and minutes. With real-time updates, boxing fans no longer need to calculate the time left until a match, sparing them the headache of time zone conversions.
